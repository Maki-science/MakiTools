# MakiTools
Some useful tools I created for me and others that want to use them (at their own risk!).

I might advance this to a proper R package when I find some spare time. Some functions might also gain an own package once they are developed sufficiently.

So far the functions work for me as far as I tested. However, elaborated, or automated tests are not included yet.


# How to use it?
## Installation
You can install the (latest) development version of these tools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maki-science/MakiTools/main/customFunctionsMaki.R")

```
All contained functions will be loaded into your environment, ready to use.
Simple tooltips are also available. However, additional tooltips, such as from help files are not included.
See the function annotations or file comments for further reading. I might expand these at some point if required.



# Troubleshooting
If there are any issues or wishes for changes, you can open an issue here on Github (https://github.com/Maki-science/MakiTools/issues).
